        I will now share with you some snapshots of our journey. The
        establishment of IIT Tirupati was announced in 2014 by the Government of
        India, along with five other new IITs. The foundation stone for the
        Institute was laid on March 28, 2015, and subsequently, the Institute
        launched its academic programme on August 5, 2015, with the support of
        its mentor Institute, IIT Madras, from a temporary campus situated on
        Tirupati-Renigunta Road. The Government of Andhra Pradesh provided this
        picturesque 548 acres of land with a mountain as a backdrop to develop
        the permanent campus of the Institute. The campus is planned to be
        developed in multiple stages. A master plan has been prepared to build a
        campus to eventually cater to Director's Report 12,000 students while
        conserving its ecological features. The south campus consisting of
        laboratories, hostels, classrooms and sports facilities, was completed
        by 2018 using prefab and sustainable technologies. Thus, the Institute
        started partly functioning from the permanent campus in the fourth year
        of its operations.

      <Text className="text-gray-800 text-xl m-2 p-2">
        Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Phase 'A' of the
        permanent campus construction was completed by July 2023. However, the
        buildings and facilities were occupied in stages from August 2022. The
        construction primarily spanned into four zones: Academic, hostel,
        sports, and residential. The academic zone has a total built-up area of
        62,351 square meters. It includes two Department Buildings with office
        spaces and department laboratories, a Central Instrumentation Facility,
        a Lecture Hall Complex, and an Administrative Building. The hostel zone
        includes two buildings with a housing capacity of 1000 students, a
        sports utility building, and a central dining facility comprising a
        student-mess on the ground floor and a spacious food court on the first
        floor. The total built-up area of this zone is 30,170 square meters. The
        faculty and staff residential buildings consisting of 168 apartments
        have been completed and occupied in the residential zone in a total
        built-up area of 33,769 square meters. This zone also comprises a
        Director's Bungalow and a 20-room Visitors' House. In line with the
        Hon'ble Prime Minister's call of 'Catch the rain, where it falls, when
        it falls' two beautiful lakes have also been created spanning over 10
        acres of land with a capacity of 80 million litres to store and use
        rainwater in a sustainable manner.

        Academic Programmes
      </Text>
      <Text className="text-gray-800 text-xl m-2 p-2">
        The Institute commenced its operations with a total of 106 students in
        four B. Tech programmes (Civil, Computer Science & Engineering,
        Electrical & Mechanical) in 2015. M. Tech programs in Computer Science,
        Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, and B. Tech in Chemical
        Engineering were launched in 2018. Gradually, the Institute expanded its
        strength and introduced a master's programme in Mathematics and
        Statistics and M. Tech in three streams of Civil Engineering in 2019.
        The master's programmes in Chemistry and Physics were launched in 2020.
        During the academic year 2021-22, the Institute started M. Tech in
        Microelectronics & VLSI in the Electrical Engineering stream. In
        2022-23, the Institute launched a master's programme in Public Policy,
        becoming the third IIT to offer this programme. During the same academic
        year, the Institute also launched an M. Tech programme in RF and
        Microwave in Electrical Engineering stream.
      </Text>
      <Text className="text-gray-800 text-xl m-2 p-2">
        The current student strength of 1508 includes 904 B. Tech students, 179
        M. Tech students, 85 M. Sc. students, 35 MPP (Master of Public Policy)
        students, 36 MS and 269 PhD research students. It has often been pointed
        out that IITs have a skewed gender ratio. However, IIT Tirupati boasts
        of 20.46% of girl students admitted to the B. Tech programmes. The
        overall percentage of the girl students enrolled in various programmes
        at the Institute is even higher i.e., 22.74%.
